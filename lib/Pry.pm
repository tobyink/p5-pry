=head1 NAME

Pry - intrude on your code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Pry;
   
   ...;
   pry;
   ...;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Kind of a bit like a debugger, kind of a bit like a REPL.

This module gives you a function called C<pry> that you can drop into
your code anywhere. When Perl executes that line of code, it will stop
and drop you into a REPL. You can use the REPL to inspect any lexical
variables (and even alter them), call functions and methods, and so on.

All the clever stuff is in the REPL. Rather than writing yet another
Perl REPL, Pry uses L<Reply>, which is an awesome yet fairly small REPL
with support for plugins that can do some really useful stuff, such as
auto-complete of function and variable names.

Once you've finished using the REPL, just hit Ctrl+D and your code will
resume execution.

=head1 UTILITIES

The following functions are provided for your convenience. They cannot
be exported, so you should access them, from the REPL, using their
fully-qualified name.

=over

=item C<< Pry::Lexicals >>

Returns a hashref of your lexical variables.

=item C<< Pry::Trace >>

Returns the stack trace as a L<Devel::StackTrace> object.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Pry's REPL can be configured in the same way as L<Reply>.

=head1 CAVEATS

I imagine this probably breaks pretty badly in a multi-threaded or
multi-process scenario.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs to
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Pry>.
